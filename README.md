This program uses AutoIt to manually import daily stock data from Fidelity Active Trader Pro. It then parses the .csv file for each stock, followed by analyzing that data for patterns and insights to aid in daily trading use. It can also take in external user input to store in the Excel sheet that you can't obtain from price action data such as float.
